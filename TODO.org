  It must collect all directories that contain an =asd= file, for a
  given directory tree. It must do it recursively.

  Next, those collected path must be added to the ASDF registry
  global variable =asdf:*central-registry*=.
* TODO Add a directory for the management of DBMS

  This directory should contain one file per database management
  system. The priority must be toward plain text lisp format.

  Foreseen format:
  - fact-base
  - sexp - =com.informatimago.common-lisp.cesarum=

  Location: =#P"cl/is/"=
  Directory name: =#P"dbms/"=

  These source files are responsible for providing a common API to
  access data stored in files of the given format. This includes
  opening and closing the file, and ensuring that any buffered data
  is written when closing the file.

  Foreseen API:
  - =open=, connect the calling application to the database
  - =close=, close the connection
  - crud API:
    - =insert= / =create=, add a record to the database
    - =read=, read a record from the data base
    - =update=, update a record in the database
    - =delete=, remove a record from the database
  - =load=, load the database in memory for use by the crud API
  - =save=, save all the changes to the database
* TODO Add a file to provide a query API for the information system

  File name: =query.lisp=
  Location: =#P"cl/is/"=

  Foreseen functions and macros:
  - =search=: will allow to search for entries in a information
              system for data corresponding to given criteria.
    - Parameters:
      - =is=: information system.
      - =path=: the search will be limited to elements present at that path.
      - =condition=: the condition to match to collect a value.
      - =fields=: a list of fields whose data must be returned.
    - Possible Returned values:
      - A list of records, if the query is successful.
      - =nil=, if the query returns nothing.
      - a complex lisp object, in case of error, with all the data to
        help diagnose the problem.

  Foreseen criteria:
  - =one-of=: The field must contains one of the element in the
              provided list or vector.
  - =unique=: The value must be present only once in the scope.
  - =and=
  - =or=
  - =not=
* TODO Add a file to provide a write API for the information system
  :PROPERTIES:

  :END:
  File name: =record.lisp=
  Location: =#P"cl/is/"=
   
  Foreseen function:
  - =write=: open access to the given path, write the provided data and close the data store.
  - =with-is-path=: allows to perform multiple operation on the provided path.
  - =delete=: delete the data at path.
  - =update=: update the data at path with the new one.
* TODO Add a source file to manage an information system initialisation

  :END:
  File name: =boot.lisp=
  Location: =#P"cl/is/"=

  The file must provides ways to initialize a new file system, but
  also to boot an existing one. And to ensure that the calling
  program can manage the data consistently.

  Foreseen function:
  - =init-information-system=: creates an new information system.
    - =is-name=: name of the information system.
    - =description=: a text describing the information system.
    - =ism-location=: an empty directory where the information system manager
      this information system will reside.
    - =default-dbms=: the default dbms to use to store data.
  - =boot-information-system=: prepare an existing information system
    to be used by the calling program.
    - =location=: A directory containing an information system manager.
